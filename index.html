    <h2><b>About Me</b></h2>
    <p>
     Hello, my name is Matthew, and I am a Computer Science Major. Some
     of my favorite classes that I have taken throughout college are: Mobile Application
     Development, Virutal and Augmented Reality, Game Development, and this one! The langauge
     I am most comfortable coding in is C++, but another langauge that I have picked up is Kotlin,
     for the Mobile App Dev class. The coding structure between Kotlin and HTML is pretty similar
     so I am interested in learning more about HTML.
     </p>

    <li> <img src= "Budget.png" alt="Budget" width=“200”  height="275" class = "center"/>
    <li><blockquote>This project is the Budgeting App. I worked on this project in my Mobile App Dev 
                     class in a team of 2. This was built in Android Studio with Kotlin. My teammate mainly 
                     worked on the UI, while I worked on the functionality. You are able to set your budget, 
                     add and delete expenses, sort them in categories, as well as some other functionalities.

     <li><blockquote>This project is the VR Escape Puzzle. I worked on this project in my VR and AR class in 
                     a team of 4. This was built in Unity with some C# scripting aspects. I worked on the starting room, 
                     first puzzle room, and scripting for a flashlight. This project is set in a tomb, where you have to 
                     solve three different puzzles to escape.
